        Welcome to my corner of the web! I am
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-duedu-05a026199/">
          Maxwell Duedu.
        </a>
        Depending on my mood I am a Software Engineer or a technical writer. I
        have written a number of technical blogs in which I broke down complex
        topics and defined some best practices to implement in code. As an
        engineer and a technical writer, my goal is to develop tools of
        technological advancements that not only solve current problems but also
        pave the way for future breakthroughs. When I'm not pushing codes and
        writing blogs, you'll find me sharing my love of CSS on my YouTube,
        reading a book or traveling to see new places.
